## Approach
In this design, I tried to practice using grid layout. I experimented with 12,9,6,3 grids. I found them to be rather unweidly, so more practice for the future is definitely needed.
I focused on trying to hack together a responsive design with the little knowledge I had. I wasn't sure how to nest media queries, so opted for 3 seperate lists of css which without a doubt is not the best approach.
In my next design I will focus on slimming down my css file and focusing on responsive design as I progress.

## JS
I also implimented my first part of JS into one of my designs, programatically changing the src of an image as the window width changed. I could've done this with media queries and css, but wanted to start relying on JS a little bit more.
